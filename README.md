# classification-of-CIFAR100-dataset
improvement
The implementation of Resnet101 to solve the problem of cifar100 image classification.
I trained a resnet101 in the dataset CIFAR100, eventually got 94.74% top5 accuracy, 79.01% top1 accuracy. The data set contains 60,000 labeled color images, which are 32*32 in size and are divided into 10 categories with 6,000 images in each category. There are 50,000 for training, 5,000 for each class, and 10,000 for testing, 1,000 for each class. Thereâ€™s three models we adopt in this experiment and get the fabulous results which showed in the tables. Resnet50 , Resnet101 and Shufflenet , such three models shows their own various characteristics in the following reports.
